## Reporting Requirements

You should submit a C++ project that meets as many of the requirements as possible.

You should also submit a short written report explaining your object-oriented design. The report should include a UML class diagram and a short explanation of the meanings of the class(es), attribute(s) and behaviour(s), as well as a
brief description of the object-oriented design process that you went through to produce your design.

To help you in producing this report, a sample model report will be made available to you through the KEATS system (called *Sample model report for coursework 3*).

Your report should not need to be longer than 3 pages of A4, and can be shorter.

Submission will be via the KEATS system.

The submission point will only allow you to upload a single file so you should combine all files into a single ZIP file. **Please make sure your ZIP file does not contain any executables!** The submission system's antivirus protection tends to reject anything it detects as containing executables due to concerns around malware, etc. Please make sure to *clean* your build prior to creating the ZIP file.

Late submissions (within 24 hours of this deadline) will be accepted but 10 raw marks will be deducted from the coursework mark. If the deduction takes a student below the pass mark, the coursework mark will be capped at the pass mark. Work submitted after the 24-hour deadline will receive a mark of zero. 

If your program does not meet all requirements then please submit what you have written by the deadline.



## Assessment

Your coursework will be marked on a number of factors:

- Does the program work? Does it meet all requirements? Has it been tested extensively? (50%)
- Program design and appropriate use of C++ language features, e.g. functions, classes, composition / aggregation / inheritance as appropriate, etc. (30%)
- Written report (15%)
- Use of comments, indentation and variable / function names to make code easy to understand (5%)

The overall mark for this coursework will make up 30% of your total mark for this module.

**This is an individual assignment. You are not permitted to work together with any other student.** Note that general discussions about design decisions and/or coding strategies are permitted, and such discussions can be a useful learning experience for you. But you should not, under any circumstances, share details of designs or code.
