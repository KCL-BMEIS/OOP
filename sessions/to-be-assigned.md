# Open questions:

- how use inheritance in a meaningful way without pointers?
  - should be fine using *references* instead
- how to demonstrate aggregation without pointers?
  - can demonstrate construction of member (const) reference 
  - note that [non-const references are not recommended in the C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rc-constref)
    - but only because this makes the class copy-constructable, but not copy-assignable
    - if anything, highlights issues of ownership and lifetime, which are a serious problem with aggregation
- [blog abour OOP design process](https://www.mdfaisal.com/blog/first-5-steps-of-object-oriented-design)
  - how to teach design?
  - how to *assess* design?
