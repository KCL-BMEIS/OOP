## object-oriented design

# What we have learned so far

**By now, you should be able to:**
.columns[
.col[
- use the terminal and navigate around the filesystem
- write, compile and run a small C++ program
- use `for` loops and `if` statements
- use standard data types, including `std::string` and `std::vector`
]
.col[
- write and use your own functions **and classes**
- read and write basic information to & from file
- handle command-line arguments and options
- split your code across multiple `cpp` and header files
]
]

**You should also have a good understanding of:**
.columns[
.col[
- error handling using C++ exceptions
- (const) references
- variable scope
- **the `const` keyword in various contexts**
]
.col[
- the `inline` keyword
- namespaces
- the compile & link process
- **OOP design principles: abstraction and encapsulation**
]
]

**If you struggle with any of these aspects, please ask for help!**
