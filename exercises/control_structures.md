# Exercises: Control structures

## Exercise 1

In a previous exercise, we wrote a C++ program to compute 
the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides *a*, *b* and *c*,
according to the equation

$$
A = s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c)
$$

where *s* is half of the sum of the three sides. However, this equation
can only be used if the values of *a*, *b* and *c* represent a valid triangle.
This is true if, for each of the three sides, its length is less than the
sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides.

Modify your solution to that previous exercise so that it first
checks if the numbers entered represent a valid triangle. If they do, the
program should compute and display the area of that triangle. If they
do not then throw an exception with the message "Not a valid triangle".

## Exercise 2

The equation for computing a person’s body mass index (BMI) is:

$$
\textrm{BMI} = \textrm{mass} \times \textrm{height}^2
$$

where the mass is in kilograms and the height is in metres. A BMI
of less than 18.5 is classified as underweight, between 18.5 and 25 is
normal, between 25 and 30 is overweight and more than 30 is obese.

Write a C++ program that takes the mass and height of the user as input 
(whether as command-line arguments or through the terminal),
computes their BMI and then display their classification according to
the rules described above.

## Exercise 3

In a previous exerecise, we debugged a C++ program to compute
the roots of a quadratic equation of the form:

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

The formula for solving for x is:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

However, this equation is only valid if the roots are real, i.e. if *b*<sup>2</sup> &ge;
4*ac*. 

Modify your solution to the previous exercise so that after
reading the values of *a*, *b* and *c* it first checks to see if the roots of
the equation are real. If they are, it computes and displays the roots.
Otherwise it displays a message informing the user that the roots are
imaginary.

## Exercise 4

Write a C++ program that calculates and prints out all of the prime
numbers between 1 and 50.

---

## Exercise 5

Modify your solution to Exercise 1 so that, after computing the area of
a triangle, the program asks the user if they want to compute another
area. The user should enter either ‘y’/‘Y’ or ‘n’/‘N’. Based on this
answer the program should either exit or prompt the user to enter
values for *a*, *b* and *c* again. The program should compute the area of
one triangle before asking the user if they want to proceed.

## Exercise 6

The Fibonacci series is a sequence of integer numbers, starting with 0 & 1,
such that each subsequent number in the sequence is equal to the
sum of the previous two. For example, the beginning of the sequence
is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc. Write a C++ program that computes and
prints the Fibonacci series up to a maximum value of 10000 (i.e. when
the sum of the previous two numbers is greater than 10000 the program
should stop).

## Exercise 7

In numerical analysis, the Newton-Raphson method is a method for
successively finding better approximations of the root(s) of a function.
To approximate the unknown value of x that satisfies the equation
f(x) = 0, the method works as follows (see figure below):

![newton-raphson](exercises/newton-raphson.png)

1. Make an initial guess at the solution - call this x<sub>1</sub>
2. Calculate y<sub>1</sub> = *f*(x<sub>1</sub>)
3. Calculate the derivative, *y*<sub>1</sub>', of *f*(x) at x<sub>1</sub>
4. Approximate *f*(x) at (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) using the tangent to the curve. This
tangent crosses the x-axis at the point (x<sub>2</sub>, 0), where x<sub>2</sub> = x<sub>1</sub> −
(y<sub>1</sub>/y<sub>1</sub>')
5. Use x<sub>2</sub> as the next guess at the solution and repeat from step (2)

This sequence of steps should continue until some convergence condition, e.g. (x<sub>n</sub> − x<sub>n−1</sub>) < ϵ.

Write a C++ program to find the root of the equation f(x) = cos(x)−x
using the Newton-Raphson method. (The derivative of cos(x) − x is
−sin(x) − 1.)

## Exercise 8

Write a C++ program that reads in a sequence of positive integers from
the keyboard. When a negative number is entered the program should
stop reading numbers and output the sum, range (i.e. maximum minus
minimum) and mean of the positive integers.

*Hint:* the `<limits>` header include file defines functionality to 
[query the minimum and maximum values](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/numeric_limits) 
for all the generic data types, for example:

```
const int int_min = std::numeric_limits<int>::min();
const int int_max = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
```

You can use these to initialise your minimum and maximum
values.

## Exercise 9

Write an interactive C++ program that successively reads a floating
point number from the keyboard followed by an integer code. If the
code entered is a 1 the program should display the sine of the floating
point number. If it is a 2 it should display the cosine, and if it is a 3
it should display the tangent. The program should terminate when the
code entered is −1. If a code other than 1, 2, 3 or −1 is entered the
program should inform the user and ask them to re-enter the numbers.
Use a switch statement in your solution.

## Exercise 10

In the 18th century Leonard Euler showed that:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{n^2}
$$

converges to *π*<sup>2</sup>/6 for very large *N*. 

Write a program that estimates the value of *π*
using this approximation, and finds the value of *N* for which the error
in the approximation becomes less than 0.001.
